# Project #1: Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe also known as noughts and crosses is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns clicking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks on horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.

### Approach taken
Planned simple user interface for the game.
Broke down the problem into smaller sections and worked on getting the game logic working right on javascript.
Once the game was working good enough, ie. it shows a message when a winner is found, adds the wins to counter, resets the board, etc.
I added some styles to the interface.
Other goals is to have customisable options, animation, creative styles and twists.
